This module will deploy an s3 remote backend for terraform

#1 You'll probably want to write more documentation, such as what the inputs and outputs are and how to use them

use this to generate readme from code

Terraform-docs (https://github.com/segmentio/terraform-docs) is a neat open source tool that automatically generates documentation from your configuration code. I highly recommend it.
